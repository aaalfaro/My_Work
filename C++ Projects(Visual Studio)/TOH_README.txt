What is it:

This program replicates the towers of hanoi game. For those who aren't familiar with the game, the goal is to move the rings from the first peg to the third peg without stacking a larger peg on top of a smaller peg. 
Users don't have to worry about breaking this rule because the program won't allow it.

How it works:

The user will be prompted to enter the amount of rings he wants they want. Click on the peg to take its top ring and click on the peg you want to move it to. If the user finds themselves stuck they can right click and find two options, reset and solution. Reset, as the name suggests, resets the game with all the pegs back on the first peg. The user does not need to re-enter how many rings they want. Solution resets the game and the game will then proceed to solve itself, showing the user the moves needed for the solution. (Warning: the solution is slowed down so that the user can see the solution. The more rings you have, the longer the solution.)

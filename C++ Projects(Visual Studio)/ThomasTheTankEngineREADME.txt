Purpose:
This program was done at the end of the semester for my computer graphics class. Our goal was to make an interactive program for one of the CS professor's 5 yr old son. The only information the class was given is that he likes Thomas the tank engine, Mickey Mouse, and Paw patrol. With this information I decided to make an interactive Thomas the tank engine.

How does it work:

The user controls a Train model that looks like Thomas the tank engine using w,a,s,d. The train can only move along the tracks and cannot go in reverse.

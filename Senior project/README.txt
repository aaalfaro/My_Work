Context -
 In my school, students can earn extra points by attending voluntary lectures. The way that professors keep track of which lecture a student attends is through a sign in sheet that is passed around before the lecture starts. This was inefficient, as the time it takes for all attendants to sign the sheet often cut in to the lecture and sometimes students miss the sheet and they form a long line after the lecture is over because there is only one sign in sheet. This inefficiency gave me the idea of making an app that allows students to sign in quickly and at the same time keep track of how many points the student earned and which lecture they attended.

How this app works-
 Once the app is opened, the user is prompted to input their email and password. Once the user hits submit, the program will then connect to a database (Note: this is an internal database that is only accessible on campus). This database is one that I made and populated using MySQL and with the information on students that gave their consent. A PHP script is used to check the user's email and password to check whether they entered their information correcty, this is all done using SQL queries checking a table that contains information on the students. Once the user enters the correct information, the camera on their device is activated. The user will then scan a QR code that is associated with the lecture being held that day. Once scanned, a PHP script enters the students information in the table that is associated with the lecture. The script checks on whether the user has already signed in, so re-scanning and earning free points is impossible. The html page called form allows professors to do two things. One is to check what lectures a student has been to and how many extra points they have and second is to enter in the name of a new lecture. This creates a new table that will be used to populate with the information of students that sign in.

Prerequisites- 
 To run this program you will need Android Studio along with access to a database. Some of the code in the HTTPhelper class needs to be changed in order to connect to the database of your choice and a SQL text file of the tables that I used are provided. The PHP scripts need altered as well, with the correct information to connect to your database
